# X Education Lead Conversion Project

Welcome to the X Education Lead Conversion Project repository! This project aims to improve lead conversion rates and identify potential 'Hot Leads' for X Education, an online education company targeting industry professionals.

## Project Overview

X Education faces the challenge of a low lead conversion rate despite acquiring a significant number of leads. The primary objective of this project is to identify the most promising leads (referred to as 'Hot Leads') to focus the sales team's efforts more efficiently, ultimately increasing the lead conversion rate.

## Key Steps Taken

The project followed a structured approach involving:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding data statistics and distributions.
   - Identifying correlations between features and the target variable.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features to improve predictive power.
   - Feature selection to choose the most influential attributes.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Selecting and training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for binary classification.
   - Evaluating model performance using various metrics.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.

5. **Hot Lead Identification:**
   - Using the trained model to predict lead conversion probabilities.
   - Prioritizing leads with higher conversion potential as 'Hot Leads.'

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**
   - Implementing the model into the lead acquisition process.
   - Establishing a feedback loop with the sales team for ongoing refinement.

## Learnings and Insights

Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights and skills, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
